# bolbir | Simple Search Appliction

Bolbir is based on the Algolia Search API to map result from your search term. Very simple, it is made with Love and passion.

Some functionalities have been added to make it more lively. People can see what others have searched for, how many have searched for the same thing and they can leave comments on what they searched for to help others searching for the same thing to know their mind on the topic.

You can contribute to this by bringing up your own ideas and solutions to implement more functionalities. Let's enjoy ;)

Technologies Used: React, React Motion, Node, Express and Redis.

Use:  - npm install
      - npm start(at the project root)
      
NB: Make sure you have Redis installed on your machine ;)
